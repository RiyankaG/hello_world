# hello_world

I would love for my final idea to be almost an online exhibit of powerful women leaders in history and in present. The theme would be “You deserve to take up space” and I would love to have planets moving across the page, and each time one moves it would reveal the face of a female leader. The background would be space as is currently in my website. 

I understand everything I have done so far except how to control what the triangle seems to be doing on the page. It creates this sweeping shape I thought looked great so I decided to include it.

Going forward these are the questions I would love answered: 
1.	What shapes do they triangles form, especially when you add speed?
2.	How do you make an image of your choice move? 
3.	How do you stop the background image in html from repeating? 
4.	How do you have consecutive movement functions, so you can time movement? 
5.	How do incorporate both html and js to make images move?
